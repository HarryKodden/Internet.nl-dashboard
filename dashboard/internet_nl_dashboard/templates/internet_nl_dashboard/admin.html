    <h2>Admin features</h2>
    <p>Some nice power user features.</p>

    <h3>Switch Account</h3>
    <p>This feature allows you to switch to another account, and see this website from their perspective.</p>
    <form class="nav-link" method="POST">
        {% csrf_token %}

            {% for account in accounts %}

    </form>

    <h3>About Users, DashboardUsers and Accounts</h3>
    <p>This system knows users, dashboardusers and account. This might be confusing at first, and this might help
    you getting started.</p>
    <p>Anyone that can log into this system has a user account. The standard user account has been extended a bit:
    it makes it possible to become part of a larger 'Account'.</p>
    <p>The larger Account holds the list with urls and has reports associated to it. This way multiple users can
    work on the same set of data.</p>
    Todo: drop Enable Logins per Account.
