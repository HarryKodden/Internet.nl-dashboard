            about_content: '<h1>About Internet.nl</h1><h2>What is Internet.nl?</h2><p>Internet.nl helps you to check whether your internet is up to date. Do your <a href="/test-site/">website</a>, <a href="/test-mail/">email</a> and <a href="/test-connection/">internet connection</a> use <strong>modern and reliable Internet Standards</strong>? And if they don\'t, what can you do about it?</p><h2>What are Internet Standards?</h2><p>In order to exchange data between computers around the world, we need international agreements on how computers talk to one another. The digital "plugs and sockets" that link everything together, so to speak. These agreements are called Internet Standards or internet protocols. An example is SMTP, a well-known protocol for sending email. This technical core of the internet is unvisible and unknown to most users. However it is crucial for a working internet today and in the future.</p><h2>Why is it important to be up to date?</h2><p>The original internet standards date from the 70s and 80s, when the number of internet users was small. Nowadays, there are more than three billion users worldwide! And these people use the internet more and more for transactions that are privacy-sensitive and costly. The old standards cannot meet this scale nor the modern safety requirements. For instance, criminals are abusing the SMTP standard to spoof the sender address of an email. This means that we have to start using new, smarter standards that keep our internet reliable. The good news is that these modern Internet Standards are available.</p><h2>Are the Netherlands taking the lead in using modern Internet Standards?</h2><p>Unfortunately, that is not the case. Even in a modern country like the Netherlands (that became the first internet connected European country in 1988) we use too many outdated standards that fall short of reliability. Not using these modern standards is a risk for the individual internet user, but also for the Dutch economy and for the world at large. Therefore, please help improving the internet and make sure that you use modern Internet Standards.</p><h2>Who should act on modern Internet Standards?</h2><p>Our access, hosting and email providers should take care of implementing modern internet standards and setting them correctly. Do the test results show any shortcomings? Then please send a message about this to your provider(s). If you use your own connection, webserver or mailserver, you have to take care of the correct settings yourself.</p><h2>Why don’t you address the access, hosting and email providers directly?</h2><p>We do. Still it is important that internet users are aware themselves and send out signals to their provider(s) as well. This may come as a surprise, but in a modern country like the Netherlands we still use many standards that are outdated and lack reliability. Therefore please help us to improve the internet together, and demand modern Internet Standards.</p><h2>Who is behind Internet.nl?</h2><p>The website Internet.nl is an initiative of the Dutch <strong>Internet Standards Platform</strong>.

Adjustments will be announced through news items on our website. New subtests will (usually) not impact the score after their initial release and have the \'RECOMMENDED\' or \'OPTIONAL\' status. In the future these new items could get the \'REQUIRED\' status and weigh in the overall score.</p><h3>How does the score relate to security?</h3><p>Although many of the tested Intern Standards contribute to a higher security level of your website, mail service or internet connection, a 100% score does not mean that an online service is fully secure. There are more aspects which are important for the security of your online services. But these are out of scope for Internet.nl.

They will be shown in the test reports available for the user via a permalink and could be shown in the Hall of Fame.</li><li>Only the domain name is stored, but <em>not</em> the \'local-part\' (i.e. the part before @example.nl) of a provided email address.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Server logs</h4><p>For debugging connection issues and for solving (security) incidents we keep the below data in our web server logs. </p><ul><li>IP address of the client (remote host) which made the request to our web server;</li><li>The time that the request was received;</li><li>User-Agent HTTP request header that the client browser reported about itself;</li><li>Status code that the server sends back to the client;</li><li>Size of the object returned to the client;</li><li>Error message with regard to processing the request.</li></ul><h4>User analytics</h4><p>We put analytical cookies on your device to analyze the use of our website. We run Matomo (formerly Piwik) on our own web server. Matomo is one of the most privacy-friendly analytical tools currently available. The statistics generated with these cookies are used only to improve our website. </p><p>We collect the following data via cookies:</p><ul><li>IP address (anonymized);</li><li>Very rough location of the user based on anonymized IP address; </li><li>Date and time;</li><li>Title of the page being viewed;</li><li>URL of the page being viewed;</li><li>URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page;</li><li>Screen resolution;</li><li>Time in local timezone;</li><li>Files that were clicked and downloaded;</li><li>Link clicks to an outside domain;</li><li>Pages generation time;</li><li>Main Language of the browser;</li><li>User Agent of the browser.</li></ul><p>Because the impact of these analytical cookies on your privacy is very limited in light of the GDPR and Section 11.7a of the Dutch Telecommunication Act, you do not need to give your consent for this.

ECP is in charge of operating the mailbox. Collected data may be shared with other <a href="/about/">members of the Internet Standards Platform</a> only to answer questions, to solve issues or to improve our services. </p><p>No third party services are used (like external analytics tooling or web fonts). We do not in any way pass on personal data collected by us to third parties (i.e. outside the Internet Standards Platform), unless we are legally obliged to do so (for example, if the authorities with a legal basis request data from us). </p><h3>Technical measures</h3><p>We have implemented a.o. the following technical measures to secure your personal data:</p><ul><li>Modern, secure standards are in place. We comply with our own tests. E.g. our web server offers an encrypted connection (HTTPS) and the domain is signed (DNSSEC);</li><li>Software on our servers is updated regularly;</li><li>Our engineers use strong authentication to access the servers.</li></ul><p>In case you find a vulnerability, despite of our efforts, please act in accordance with our <a href="/disclosure/">responsible disclosure</a> policy.</p><h3>Anonymization</h3><ul><li>Application: The anonymization of the IP address of your client means that at least the last 16 bits of each IPv4 address and the last 96 bits of each IPv6 address are discarded and replaced with zero\'s before storing in the application database (e.g. visible is only 198.51.0.0 or 2001:db8::). Besides we anonymize the found reverse name by masking the first one or more labels. By anonymizing the IP address and reverse name we make sure that it is not possible to relate these directly to a person anymore, even not with the other associated data colllected. IP addresses belonging to web servers, mail servers or name servers will not be anonymized, because we consider this data to be public data which is published in DNS. The same goes for domain names; we also consider this to be public data. </li><li>User analytics: At least 16 bits for IPv4 and 80 bits for IPv6 are discarded and replaced with zero\'s before storing an IP address in our analytics tooling (e.g. visible is only 198.51.0.0 or 2001:db81:85a3::).</li></ul><h3>Data retention period</h3><ul><li>Application: Because the anonymized visiting IP address and associated collected data can not be directly related to a person, we do not maintain a specific retention period for the data stored in our aplication database.</li><li>Server logs: Data collected in our server logs will be deleted after three calendar months.</li><li>User analytics: Individual visitor data (including the anonymized IP address) in our analytics tooling will be deleted after 90 days.</li></ul><h2>Inspection, correction and deletion of data</h2><p>Pursuant to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right of access to your personal data upon request and, if necessary, to amend it or have it deleted. Please <a href="/about/">contact us</a> in case you wish to do so. Because we keep your full IP address only temporarily in our server logs, you might need to supply us with additional information, such as about your device and browser as well as the date and time of your visit, for us to be able to honour your request.</p><h2>Update privacy statement</h2><p>We may change our privacy statement. We will announce this change on our website. Older versions of our privacy statement will be stored in our archive. Send us an email if you want to consult it.</p>',
